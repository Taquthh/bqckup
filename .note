is it better to save the data as a file ? just like virtualmin
WhY ????
    - most of developer is too lazy to start the service ( service ojtbackup start ) then fill the form to setup a backup
    - it's really simple for them to create 1 config ( file ) without turn on the service

What about the validation such as test connection database and validate the path is exists or not ??
    we can create test function like nginx ( nginx -t ) to validate if the config is valid and ready to use
    also we can provide the cli feature, for example:
        - bqckup --test-config (test config)
        - bqckup --check-cloud-storage --name ojtbackup ( check storage s3 )
        - bqckup --check-server-storage

example:
    1. .config/backups/name.yml ( Backup Config such as path, database, retention, etc)
    2. .config/.auth_key ( auth key to login just like s3.openjournaltheme.com)
    3. .config/.bq_config.yml ( apps configuration )

todo:
    1. Can't use app if do not have storages
    2. Config test
    3. CLI

note:
    primary storage -> a storage that u want show the information about it in dashboard

also it's really easy to apply multiple storage if it's as a file, example:

```
storages:
    ojtbackup:
        - bucket: 
        - key_id:
        - key_secret:
    openjournalthemeproduct:
        - bucket: 
        - key_id:
        - key_secret:
```

and for the backup:
```
backups:
    openjournaltheme.com:
        - path:
        - database:
            - user:
            - password:
            - name:

        - options:
            - save_locally:
            - interval:
            - time_to_backup:
            - notification_email:
```
