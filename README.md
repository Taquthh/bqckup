## Background

As a programmer with multiple clients to manage, the importance of regularly backing up databases and associated assets cannot be overstated. As my client base expands, so too must the tools I use to ensure that these backups are comprehensive, reliable, and automated. I need a system that handles backups seamlessly, with minimal input from me, and only alerts me when there is an issue that requires my attention, such as a failed backup. Furthermore, I require a tool that supports a wide range of storage providers, including S3 protocol, giving me the flexibility and control I need to ensure that my backups are secure and easily accessible.
